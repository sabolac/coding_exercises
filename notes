Interview:

Source 1) LeetCode:
    https://leetcode.com/

    I solved some Medium and Hard questions here (I may have solved around 25 questions).
    I've found some of the Hard questions too extreme.
    Even though I could solve most of them, I don't think they make good interview questions.

    This book mostly has programming questions, but it also have design questions (15 of them).
